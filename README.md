# Effect of advertising on social networks
The aim of this project is to model the effect of advertising on different social network topologies. The project is based on the idea that the effect of advertising on social networks is not only dependent on the number of people who see the advertisement, but also on the structure of the network. We aim to answer the following questions: Does the effectivness of advertising depend on the network topology? Who should we target in the advertising if we want to reach the best effectiveness for each network topology? We will consider four different network topologies and 5 types of advertising. The scenario is as follows: there is a referendum coming up, and there are two  ompeting campaigns. Each person has a continuous opinion on the issue, which can be influenced by advertising. The collective opinion in the starting opinion is roughly even. The goal of the project is to model the effect of advertising on the final opinion of the population, and to compare the effect of advertising on different network topologies.

**Complete information about the model, types of advertising strategies and topologies, simulation details, analysis and final results of the whole project can be found in the IV109_report.pdf file.**
